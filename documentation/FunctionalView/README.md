# Functional View

The functional view describes the system requirements to specify what the system does from a user perspective.

It was decided to use a User Story driven approach to ensure that whatever functionality the system provides will provide real value to the users of the system.

## [Actors](./Actors/README.md)

The actors describe the users and other non human things like other system outside of the StoreMan system that interacts directly with the StoreMan system. For non human actors it is important to note that these other systems are not seen as part of the StoreMan system.

A full description of the StoreMan actors can be found [here](./Actors/README.md)
