# Documentation
The documentation of the StoreMan system is organised in a locical fashion with nested sub folders as required by the specific type of documentation.

The following sections decribe the top level documentation topics.

## [Functional View](./FunctionalView/README.md)
The functional view describes the system requirements to specify what the system does from a user perspective.

It was decided to use a User Story driven approach to ensure that whatever functionality the system provides will provide real value to the users of the system.

The functional view can be found [here](./FunctionalView/README.md).

## Architecture View

The architecture view of the system describes the technology choices made for the technologies that will run in **production**. It also details how different technologies will be integrated to work together in order to solve the requirements of the system.

The architecture view excludes technology choices of technologies used purely during the development and testing phases of the project. These technologies will be found in the DevOps view.
